# Cadence
An app that builds a tailored music playlist based on the usersâ€™ music preferences and running session. Users input their desired running route and select the type of run (e.g., long run, easy run, sprints) for their session. The Google Maps API is used to retrieve elevation data along the specified running route for playlist customization. Spotify API is leveraged to access music and dynamically generate a playlist based on the user profile and preferences.
