Cadence is an app that builds a tailored music playlist based on the usersâ€™ music preferences and running session. Users plot their desired running route using the Mapbox API and select their run goals (e.g., target pace, target time, target intensity) for their session. The Graphhopper API is then used to retrieve elevation data along the specified running route. The Spotify API is leveraged to dynamically generate a playlist based on the user's goals and preferences.

```

Sign up to use the [Mapbox API](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/overview/), the [Graphhopper API](https://www.graphhopper.com/developers/), the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api), and the [Cloudinary API](https://cloudinary.com/developers).

Save your API keys in a file called <kbd>config.py</kbd> using this format:

```
class Config:
  MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN="YOUR_KEY_HERE"
  SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_ID_HERE"
  SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_SECRET_HERE"
  CLOUDINARY_KEY="YOUR_KEY_HERE"
  CLOUDINARY_SECRET="YOUR_SECRET_HERE"
```

Also save the following API keys in a file called <kbd>secrets.js</kbd> using this format:

```
class Config:
  export const MAPBOX_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY_HERE"
  export const GRAPHHOPPER_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY_HERE"
